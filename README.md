unlock the robots in the joints section. Now they can be controlled with botop

# E-stops
The two grey buttons on the table labeled L and R are E-Stops for the pandas.
Those will stop their respective robot and them into user-mode (white light) where no commands can be send.
Do not hesitate to push them if something seems wrong.
The red E-stop instantly cuts power to both pandas. Use this one only for worst case scenarios.
